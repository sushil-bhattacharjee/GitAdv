#### GIT RESET ###

[commit-A]--[commit-B]--[commit-C]--[commit-D]--[commit-E]--[commit-F]--[commit-G]

$ git reset HEAD~4
There are three options for get reset, "--soft", "--mixed", and "--hard"

**By default it is "--mixed"

$ git reset HEAD~4 --mixed # It will bring to last "commit-C", provided that it will keeps all the changes made (D,E,F,G) as "Unstaged".

$ git reset HEAD~4 --soft # It will bring to last "commit-C", provided that it will keeps all the changes made (D,E,F,G) as "Staged".

$ git reset HEAD~4 --hard # It will bring to last "commit-C", provided that it will not keep any changes that were made (D,E,F,G). 
                          # Even it will delete the file if any made in these any commit(D,E,F,G).


##### GIT REVERT ####

[commit-A]--[commit-B]--[commit-C]--[commit-D]--[commit-E]--[commit-F]--[commit-G]

*** $ git reset command can't undo a specific commit, where git revert can.
** git reset command can moves back to previous number of 1,2,3,4 commit but it can't go back to specific commit that made at exa, [commit-D]
** git revert command can moves back to a particular commit like [commit-D], while doing so, it actually adding a new commit for that revert.
** Also note that if there was any changes made in [commit-E] and that continues till [commit-G], then if we want to revert [commit-D], it
        will show conflict, which needs to fix manually.

$ git log --oneline ## will show all the commits made along the way.

Note: switching to 'f4e109a'.

You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.

If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:

  git switch -c <new-branch-name>

Or undo this operation with:

  git switch -

Turn off this advice by setting config variable advice.detachedHead to false

HEAD is now at f4e109a commit-C
